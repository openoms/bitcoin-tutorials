## ColdCard single seed multi-location backup scheme
Original idea by [@KollerTobias](https://twitter.com/KollerTobias) and [@21isenough](https://github.com/21isenough/).  
Documentation of Coldcard backups: <https://coldcardwallet.com/docs/backups>  
The scheme only works if the seed is not locked down to a passphrase:
<https://coldcardwallet.com/docs/passphrase>  
In this case the passphrase is not tied to a PIN,
but needs to be written in the CC every time the wallet is opened.

The ColdCards should be stored uninitialized, best to be freshly acquired in the tamper resistant package from the manufacturer (<https://coldcardwallet.com>) to minimize the risk of evil-maid and supply-chain attacks.
